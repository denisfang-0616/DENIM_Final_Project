# Urch Forum Econ PhD Admissions Analyzer

## 1. Project Goal

The goal of this project is to collect unstructured conversation data from the Urch Economics PhD Forums and transform it into a structured dataset to analyze admissions trends for Top 50 Economics PhD programs. While anecdotal evidence suggests that quantitative metrics (GRE, GPA) are primary filters for admissions, there is a lack of large-scale, public datasets confirming exactly where the "bar" lies for different tiers of schools. The primary goal of this project is to use generative AI to extract structured data from thousands of forum posts to identify correlations between applicant profiles and admission outcomes.

The key research questions are:

- **What are the "hard cutoffs" for GRE Quant scores and GPA across Top 10, Top 20, and Top 50 programs?**

- **How significant is the "Math Background" signal (e.g., Real Analysis grades) compared to aggregate GPA?**

- **Has the competitiveness of admissions (average GRE/GPA of successful applicants) increased over the last decade?**
